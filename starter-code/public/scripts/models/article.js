  // This function is sending an ajax request to the server, which will recieve it then send a query to the database to grab all of the article data.  When the server sends the results of the query back to this function in the variable results it will call a function loadAll which takes the results as an input and loads all of the results.  The load all function lives in this file.  It will also take a callback function which it will initiate at the end of the function.  The callback function will differ depending on where the fetch all funciton is called.  It can take articleData as a callback in articleController.js, or adminView.initAdminPage as a callback in adminView.js.
